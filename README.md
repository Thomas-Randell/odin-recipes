# odin-recipes

The Odin Project Recipes project.
Created an index.html, recalling the html5 boilerplate.
index.html also contains various tags such as heading, paragraphs, anchor and unordered lists.

Anchor tags link to additional recipe pages that contain different levels of headings, images, and more lists both ordered and unordered.
